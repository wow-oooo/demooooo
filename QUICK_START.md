# Beardo - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Getting Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Open the Website
Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. No installation required!

```
Double-click → index.html
```

> **Admin Panel:** A basic back‑end interface is available when running the Node server. Start the server with `node server.js` and visit `http://localhost:3000/admin/login` to sign in (user `admin` / pass `secret`). Once logged in you can view the dashboard and:
>
> - See the live queue count and last modification time
> - **Manage queue entries:** view full list, remove individuals (removals persist)
>   • when you remove someone or reschedule a booking the system will generate a message
>     which clients can read by entering their phone number on the public site
>   • administrators can reschedule any pending booking (date/time)
> - Track sales: add/remove transactions, view total amount, filter by date range,
>   and export the results to CSV from the web interface
> - Manage services, barbers and gallery content (images, descriptions) from the panel
>   • When adding entries you can supply image URLs; the live site will display
>     those pictures automatically.
>
> The panel uses the site’s theme for a consistent look. Queue and sales data are
> written to `queue.json` and `sales.json` respectively so they survive restarts.


### Step 2: Explore the Website
Navigate using the menu:
- **Home** - Hero section with booking option
- **Services** - Browse all services with pricing
- **Barbers** - Meet your professionals
- **Gallery** - View portfolio
- **Reviews** - Check customer feedback
- **Contact** - Get our location and details

⚠️ **New:** The live queue section (below offers) now shows the full list of registered clients fetched from the server, not just a count. It automatically refreshes every 30 seconds and displays realtime updates as entries are added or removed.
